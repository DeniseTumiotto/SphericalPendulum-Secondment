% residual is a function to evaluate the RHS of the system
% jacobian evaluates the iteration matrix to perform the Newton iteration
% p is the initial value of the current iteration
% h is the time step size
% max_it is the maximum number of iteration
% tol is the tolerance to determine when to stop the integration step
